                <h3>Buses</h3>
                    <p>On the 12th and 13th of May there will be various connections to Fátima in which we recommend that you look for the various bus schedules available online.</p>

                    <h3>Trains</h3>

                    <p>Trains are also a possibility to get to Fátima. However, there are no train stations near Fátima making this type of travel longer and more expensive due to connections of other types of transport to the center. Although it is advisable to go to the link below to see special train schedules for the Fátima pilgrimage.</p>

                    <p>There are two train stations that are the closest to Fátima. The most common used is Chão de Maçãs that is about 25Km from the Sanctuary. The connection to Fátima is done by taxi or bus. The second train station is Caxarias that also gets you to Fátima by taxi or bus with a regular time schedule. The latter is advisable if you arrive at a later time of the day.</p>

                    <p>Alternatively, you may get off the train in Leiria (Gândola dos Olivais) where there is a taxi and shuttle service area to Leiria, where you may get on a bus to Fátima every hour.</p>
